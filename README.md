# PYTHONIC BST

A minimalistic, unbalanced Binary Search Tree written in pure Python.

The `bst` works almost like a `dict`, but keys are kept sorted and slicing is partially supported. The methods exploit *lazy execution* when possible, all relevant operations are $O(log)$ complexity.

## BASIC USAGE

```python
from bst import BST
```

* Create an empty BST: `bst = BST()`
* Duplicate a BST: `bar = BST(bst)`
* Convert from/to a dict:`bst = BST(mydict)` / `mydict = dict(bst)`
* Create a BST from a sequence of $(k, v)$ pairs: `bst = BST([(18, 5), (23, 10)])`
* Add/update an item: `bst[k] = v`
* Remove an existing item: `rm bst[k]`
* Count items: `len(bst)`
* Check wether a key is present: `if k in bst: ...`
* Check if the BST is not empty: `if bst: ...`
* Iterate forward: `for k, v in bst: ...`
* Iterate backward: `for k, v in reversed(bst): ...`
* Iterate forward on keys $k \in [k_1, k_2[$: `for k, v in bst[k1:k2]: ...`
* Iterate backward on keys $k \in ]k_1, k_2]$: `for k, v in bst[k2:k1:-1]: ...`
* Generate all the keys: `bst.keys()`
* Generate all the values: `bst.values()`
* Generate all $(k, v)$ pairs: `bst.items()`
* Standard BST-esque visits: `bst.visit_in_order()`, `bst.visit_pre_order()`, `bst.visit_post_order()`

## PERFORMANCES

The *density* (percentage of internal nodes that have two successors) and the *unbalance* (relative difference between the longest and the shortest path from the root) may be accessed as properties, although at a **significant** cost:

```python
bst = BST()
for n in range(1_000_000):
    bst[random.random()] = n
bst.density, bst.unbalance
```

may yield something like

```python
(0.5007653911148597, 0.86)
```

Initializing a BST from known data would create an almost optimized data structure:

```python
opt_bst = BST(bst)
opt_bst.density, opt_bst.unbalance
```

may yield something like

```python
(0.9073503634459752, 0.05)
```
